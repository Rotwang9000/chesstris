# Chesstris Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementations

### Core Game Mechanics
- ✅ Chess Movement Validation - ensures chess pieces move according to standard rules
- ✅ Path to King Validation - verifies pieces maintain a path to their owner's king
- ✅ Piece Acquisition System - allows players to purchase additional pieces during gameplay
- ✅ Player Pause System - enables players to temporarily pause with automatic timeout handling
- ✅ King Capture Mechanics - handles king captures with piece transfers and victory conditions

### Implementation Details

#### Piece Acquisition System
- Implemented constants for piece pricing in SOL
- Created API endpoints for purchasing pieces
- Added GameManager methods for validation and processing purchases
- Developed home zone expansion to accommodate new pieces
- Implemented transaction recording for purchases
- Added event emissions for successful and failed purchases

#### Player Pause System
- Implemented pause/resume functionality with timeout detection
- Created server-side interval for checking pause timeouts
- Added penalties for exceeding maximum pause time:
  - Removal of main island
  - Return of orphaned pieces to home zone
  - Home zone expansion to accommodate returning pieces
- Implemented event emissions for pause, resume, and timeout actions

#### Helper Methods
- _getHomeZoneBounds - retrieves home zone coordinates
- _expandHomeZoneIfNeeded - increases home zone size when necessary
- _assignHomeCells - assigns cells to a player after home zone expansion
- _createChessPiece - creates new chess pieces with unique IDs
- _placePieceInHomeZone - places pieces in the home zone with proper validation
- _removePlayerMainIsland - handles removal of a player's largest island
- _returnOrphanedPiecesToHomeZone - returns disconnected pieces to home zone
- _validateCoordinates - ensures coordinates are within board bounds
- _isPieceInHomeZone - checks if a piece is in its owner's home zone

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed the `_generateRandomColor` function to provide visually distinct player colours
- Enhanced error handling for piece placement in home zones
- Implemented proper logging system with timestamps
- Updated the `getGameState` method to handle non-existent games
- Added the missing `emitGameEvent` method for consistent event emission

## Next Steps

### Island Connectivity Implementation
- Develop the island connectivity validation system
- Implement island merging and splitting mechanics
- Add connectivity checks after piece movements
- Create event emissions for island-related events

### Complete Testing Suite
- Finalize tests for piece acquisition system
- Complete tests for pause timeout functionality
- Fix ESM import issues in security tests
- Resolve the DOM testing environment issues

### Performance Optimizations
- Optimize the path finding algorithm for large boards
- Improve home zone expansion logic for better cell utilization
- Enhance the timeout checker to use less frequent intervals

### Documentation
- Complete API documentation for all endpoints
- Add detailed explanations of game mechanics for new players
- Create diagrams for visual representation of game concepts

## Known Issues
- Some tests are failing due to issues with testing frameworks
- Socket.io client imports are missing in some security tests
- ESM modules are not properly configured for Jest testing
- DOM-related tests are missing proper testing environment configuration

By completing the above steps, the Chesstris game will have a solid foundation of core mechanics with proper testing and documentation.
