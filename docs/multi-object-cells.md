# Multi-Object Cell Structure

## Overview

The Shaktris game board now implements a multi-object cell structure, where each cell can contain multiple game objects simultaneously. This is a significant architectural improvement that enables more complex gameplay interactions and simplifies many game mechanics.

## Technical Implementation

### Before: Single Object per Cell

Previously, each cell in the game board could only contain a single object, which created limitations:

```javascript
// Old structure 
board.cells["5,3"] = {
  type: "chess",
  player: "player1",
  chessPiece: chessPiece
};
```

This made it difficult to represent multiple elements in the same position, such as a chess piece on a home zone cell.

### After: Array of Objects per Cell

Now, each cell contains an array of objects, allowing multiple elements to occupy the same position:

```javascript
// New structure
board.cells["5,3"] = [
  { 
    type: "home", 
    player: "player1",
    color: playerColor 
  },
  { 
    type: "chess", 
    pieceType: "pawn",
    player: "player1",
    pieceId: "piece-123",
    color: playerColor 
  }
];
```

## Benefits

This new structure provides several advantages:

1. **Cleaner game mechanics**: Chess pieces can occupy home zone cells without overwriting home zone data
2. **Simpler row clearing**: When a row is cleared, home zone markers can be preserved while removing other objects
3. **More realistic gameplay**: Tetrominos can be placed on top of home zones
4. **Enhanced visual representation**: The frontend can render multiple visual elements in the same position
5. **Better data organization**: Each object in a cell has its own clear identity and properties

## Key Updated Components

The following components were updated to support the new cell structure:

- **BoardManager**: Core class updated to handle arrays of objects per cell
- **TetrominoManager**: Modified to maintain home zone markers when placing tetrominos
- **ChessManager**: Updated to handle chess piece placement and movement with the new structure
- **Server handlers**: Updated tetromino placement and chess movement server handlers
- **Computer AI**: Updated computer player simulation logic

## Usage Examples

### Getting Cell Contents

```javascript
// Get all objects in a cell
const cellContents = boardManager.getCell(board, x, z);

// Find chess pieces in a cell
const chessPieces = cellContents.filter(item => item.type === 'chess');

// Check if a cell has a specific type of content
const hasHomeMarker = cellContents.some(item => 
  item.type === 'home' && item.player === playerId
);
```

### Adding Content to a Cell

```javascript
// Add a tetromino to a cell while preserving home markers
const cellContents = boardManager.getCell(board, x, z) || [];
const homeMarkers = cellContents.filter(item => item.type === 'home');

// Create new tetromino object
const tetrominoObj = {
  type: 'tetromino',
  pieceType: 'I',
  player: playerId,
  placedAt: Date.now()
};

// Update the cell with combined contents
boardManager.setCell(board, x, z, [...homeMarkers, tetrominoObj]);
```

### Moving Chess Pieces

```javascript
// Remove the piece from the source cell
const homeMarkersAtSource = sourceCell.filter(item => item.type === 'home');
if (homeMarkersAtSource.length > 0) {
  boardManager.setCell(board, fromX, fromZ, homeMarkersAtSource);
} else {
  boardManager.setCell(board, fromX, fromZ, null);
}

// Add the piece to the target cell
const targetCellContents = targetCell ? 
  targetCell.filter(item => item.type !== 'chess') : 
  [];
targetCellContents.push(chessPieceObj);
boardManager.setCell(board, toX, toZ, targetCellContents);
```

## Testing Considerations

Test cases have been updated to reflect the new structure. When writing new tests, remember that:

1. Cell contents are now arrays, not single objects
2. Objects within cells are identified by type and other properties
3. Empty cells are still represented as `null`

## Future Work

This multi-object cell structure enables several future gameplay enhancements:

- Multiple chess pieces per cell (stacking)
- Special cell properties that affect gameplay
- New game elements like power-ups or traps
- Advanced visual effects for multiple objects
