# Chesstris Launch Guide

This guide outlines the step-by-step process for launching Chesstris to production.

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch Preparation (1-2 Weeks Before)

### Infrastructure Setup

1. **Provision Servers**
   - Set up application servers with Node.js 16+
   - Install PM2 for process management: `npm install -g pm2`

2. **Database Setup** 
   - Create MongoDB production instance/cluster
   - Set up Redis instance with persistence
   - Configure authentication for both databases
   - Create necessary database users with minimal permissions

3. **Domain Configuration**
   - Register domain if not already done
   - Configure DNS records (A, CNAME as needed)
   - Set up SSL certificate (using Let's Encrypt or similar)

4. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Configure server monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Set up application performance monitoring
   - Configure error tracking and logging
   - Set up uptime monitoring
   - Test alerting system

### Application Preparation

1. **Code Preparation**
   - Tag release version in Git
   - Update version numbers in package.json and other relevant files
   - Ensure all dependencies are at their latest stable versions
   - Run final security audit: `npm audit --production`

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Create production .env file with all necessary variables
   - Set up CI/CD secrets for deployment
   - Double-check all sensitive configs (API keys, secrets)

3. **Documentation**
   - Finalize user documentation
   - Create FAQ page
   - Prepare support documentation
   - Document deployment process for the team

4. **Marketing Preparation**
   - Prepare launch announcement
   - Schedule social media posts

   - Brief community managers and support team

## Phase 2: Soft Launch (3-5 Days Before)

### Deployment

1. **Database Initialization**
   - Run database schema creation scripts
   - Create initial admin account
   - Add any seed data needed

2. **Server Deployment**
   - Deploy application code to production servers
   - Start application with PM2: `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production`
   - Verify all services are running correctly
   - Configure Nginx as reverse proxy

3. **Initial Verification**
   - Run automated test suite against production
   - Manually test critical paths and features
   - Verify database connections and performance
   - Check WebSocket connections and real-time updates

### Limited User Testing

1. **Invite Beta Testers**
   - Send invitations to a small group (50-100 users)
   - Provide clear feedback channels
   - Communicate that this is a beta period

2. **Monitor Closely**
   - Watch error logs in real-time
   - Monitor server performance under real usage
   - Track user behavior and pain points

3. **Rapid Iteration**
   - Address critical issues immediately
   - Deploy fixes multiple times per day if needed
   - Document all issues and their resolutions

4. **Feedback Collection**
   - Gather user feedback through various channels
   - Prioritize issues based on impact
   - Communicate fixes and improvements to testers

## Phase 3: Full Launch

### Pre-Launch Final Checks

1. **Final Testing**
   - Verify all critical bugs from soft launch are fixed
   - Run load tests with expected traffic simulation
   - Conduct security scan of the application
   - Check backup systems are working

2. **Scale Infrastructure**
   - Scale up resources based on soft launch metrics
   - Ensure databases can handle expected load
   - Configure auto-scaling if applicable
   - Verify CDN configuration for static assets

3. **Team Preparation**
   - Ensure all team members know their roles during launch
   - Set up on-call rotation for first 48 hours
   - Prepare communication templates for various scenarios
   - Brief support team on known issues and workarounds

### Launch Day

1. **Go-Live Process**
   - Conduct final team meeting before launch
   - Verify all monitoring is active
   - Remove any access restrictions from soft launch
   - Deploy final pre-launch version if needed

2. **Announcement**
   - Publish launch announcement on website
   - Send announcement to email list
   - Post on social media channels
   - Activate any launch partnerships

3. **Monitoring**
   - All hands on deck for first few hours
   - Watch key metrics in real-time
   - Monitor social media for user feedback
   - Keep team communication channel open

4. **Rapid Response**
   - Have developers ready to fix critical issues
   - Implement pre-prepared rollback plan if necessary
   - Post timely updates if any issues arise
   - Keep management informed of status

## Phase 4: Post-Launch (1 Week After)

### Stabilization

1. **Address Emerging Issues**
   - Prioritize and fix bugs based on impact
   - Deploy fixes in batches unless critical
   - Update documentation based on common issues
   - Communicate fixes to affected users

2. **Performance Tuning**
   - Optimize based on real-world usage patterns
   - Address any bottlenecks identified
   - Fine-tune caching strategies
   - Optimize database queries if needed

3. **User Engagement**
