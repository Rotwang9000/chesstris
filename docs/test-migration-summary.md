# Test Migration Summary

## Overview

We've successfully created a comprehensive solution for migrating the Shaktris test suite from Chai/Sinon to Jest. This document summarises the work completed, current status, and recommendations for completing the migration.

## Accomplishments

1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Created automated conversion scripts for Chai/Sinon to Jest translation
   - Developed Jest helper utilities to mimic Chai/Sinon behaviour
   - Updated Jest configuration to better handle ES modules and CommonJS
   - Fixed Babel configuration to properly transpile modules
   - Added support for `.jest.js` files in the Jest configuration

2. **Core Tests**
   - Manually fixed critical service tests (GameStateService, TurnSystem)
   - Successfully converted and verified basic test functionality
   - Created a pattern for handling common testing patterns

3. **Bulk Conversion**
   - Ran bulk conversion on all 40 test files
   - Each file now has a `.jest.js` version that can be tested and fixed as needed

4. **Support Tooling**
   - Created `scripts/convert-tests.js` for converting individual files
   - Created `scripts/convert-all-tests.js` for bulk conversion
   - Added `scripts/fix-jest-imports.js` to fix common import issues
   - Created `scripts/verify-single-test.js` for testing individual converted files
   - Added `scripts/verify-and-replace-tests.js` for validating and replacing converted tests

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive [Test Migration Guide](../TEST-MIGRATION.md)
   - Documented common conversion patterns
   - Updated README with testing information

## Current Status

- **37/329 Tests Passing**: We've fixed and verified 37 tests in 3 test files
- **40 Test Files Converted**: All test files have been automatically converted to Jest syntax
- **Helper Utilities**: Jest helpers created to minimise manual conversion work
- **Configuration Updated**: Jest configuration now properly recognises `.jest.js` files

## Migration Workflow

Here's the recommended workflow for completing the migration:

1. **Set Up**
   - All files have already been converted to `.jest.js` format
   - Jest configuration has been updated to recognise these files

2. **Fix and Verify**
   - Use `node scripts/verify-single-test.js <path-to-jest-file>` to test a specific file
   - Fix any issues in the converted file
   - Re-run verification until the test passes

3. **Replace Original**
   - Once tests are passing, use `node scripts/verify-and-replace-tests.js --dry-run` to check all files
   - Replace original files with `node scripts/verify-and-replace-tests.js` (no flag)
   - For individual files, manually copy with `cp <jest-file> <original-file>`

4. **Test Complete Suite**
   - Verify all tests together with `npm test`

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Jest imports | Use `node scripts/fix-jest-imports.js` to correct these |
| Mock functions not called | Replace `mock.called` with `expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalled()` |
| Deep equality checks | Use `toEqual()` instead of `toBe()` for objects |
| Timing functions | Replace clock.tick() with jest.advanceTimersByTime() |
| Missing modules | Use jest.mock() to mock missing modules or dependencies |
| ES module issues | Update imports to use require() instead of import |

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Progressive Testing**
   - Test each converted file individually: `node scripts/verify-single-test.js <file>`
   - Fix any specific issues in each file
   - Focus on core game mechanics first

2. **Replace Original Files**
   - Once a jest.js file is fully working, replace the original test file
   - Use the verification script or manual copy

3. **Prioritise by Importance**
   - Game logic tests (gameplay directory)
   - Core service tests (services directory)
   - UI and rendering tests

4. **Handle Advanced Cases**
   - Some complex mocking scenarios may need manual intervention
   - ES module imports might need special handling
   - Class mocking may require jest.mock() implementations

## Conclusion

The test migration framework is now in place. The conversion scripts have successfully translated the syntax from Chai/Sinon to Jest, but some tests will need additional fixes to address more complex issues like mocking behaviour, module imports, and timing functions.

By following the established patterns and using the tools we've created, the remaining tests can be systematically fixed. The priority should be on game mechanics and core services to ensure the game's fundamental functionality is properly tested.
