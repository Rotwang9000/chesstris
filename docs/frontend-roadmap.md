# Shaktris Frontend Development Roadmap

## Completed Tasks

1. âœ… Updated frontend developer documentation
   - Rewrote the [Frontend Developer Guide](frontend-dev.md) to reflect current project structure
   - Created [Frontend Component Model](frontend-component-model.md) for architecture guidance
   - Updated documentation to reflect completed backend implementations

2. âœ… Created sample component implementations
   - Implemented `TetrominoPreview` component using Three.js
   - Updated `App.jsx` to include routes and component integration

## High Priority Tasks (Backend Implementation Complete âœ“)

1. ðŸ”´ Implement tetromino Z-axis behavior visualization
   - Visualize tetromino disintegration at Z=1 when over existing cells
   - Show tetromino attachment at Z=0 when adjacent to cells with path to king
   - Create falling/fading animation when no valid connection
   - Add visual feedback for path-to-king connectivity requirements

2. ðŸ”´ Implement difficulty-based timing visualization
   - Create difficulty-specific turn timers:
     - Easy computer players: 15-second timer
     - Medium computer players: 10-second timer
     - Hard computer players: 5-second timer
     - Human players: 10-second minimum
   - Add visual indicators for player difficulty levels
   - Implement timing UI for turn phases

3. ðŸ”´ Visualize pawn promotion system
   - Display pawn move counter (e.g., 5/8 moves toward promotion)
   - Create promotion animation when reaching 8 moves
   - Implement visual feedback for promotion progress
   - Add celebration effects for successful promotion

4. ðŸ”´ Implement row clearing visualization
   - Create animation for clearing exactly 8 cells in a line
   - Visualize home zone protection during clearing
   - Show orphaned pieces returning to home zone
   - Implement island splitting effects

## Medium Priority Tasks

5. ðŸŸ  Implement core game board visualization 
   - Create a 3D board grid using Three.js
   - Implement camera controls for player and spectator views
   - Add visual distinction for home zones and player territories
   - Visualize home zone degradation states and expansion mechanics

6. ðŸŸ  Build chess piece movement system
   - Implement drag-and-drop for chess pieces
   - Highlight valid movement options based on chess rules
   - Create visual feedback for captures and promotions
   - Implement skipping chess move when no valid moves available

7. ðŸŸ  Enhance player status UI
   - Create player list with active/paused status indicators
   - Implement home zone status visualizations
   - Design score/captured pieces display
   - Show player turn progress and timing information
   - Display difficulty levels for computer players

8. ðŸŸ  Implement pause system visualization
   - Enhance the existing PauseControl component
   - Add countdown timer visualization for 15-minute limit
   - Implement visual indicators for paused players (grayed out pieces)
   - Add visual warnings before automatic timeout penalties
   - Show protection effects for pieces and home zones during pause

## Connection and Event Tasks

9. ðŸŸ  Connect frontend to backend via Socket.io
   - Implement proper event handling for all game events
   - Ensure synchronization of game state between players
   - Add error handling and reconnection logic
   - Implement efficient game state updates for asynchronous play

10. ðŸŸ  Develop event visualization effects
    - Implement home zone degradation visual effects
    - Design king capture ceremony with ownership transfer visuals
    - Visualize orphaned pieces returning to home zone
    - Create animations for home zone expansion when pieces return

11. ðŸŸ  Implement island connectivity visualization
    - Create visual distinction between connected and orphaned pieces
    - Animate island splits and merges
    - Provide visual feedback for path-to-king validation
    - Implement island ownership visualization

## Low Priority Tasks

12. ðŸŸ¡ Implement Solana wallet integration
    - Connect to Solana wallet
    - Create UI for piece purchases with correct SOL pricing:
      - Pawn: 0.1 SOL
      - Rook/Knight/Bishop: 0.5 SOL
      - Queen: 1.0 SOL
    - Implement transaction status and confirmation displays
    - Visualize king capture rewards (50% of defeated player's fees)

13. ðŸŸ¡ Add visual polish and optimization
    - Refine the Russian historical sky theme
    - Optimize rendering for large boards
    - Add particle effects and ambient animations
    - Implement weather and environmental effects

14. ðŸŸ¡ Implement accessibility features
    - Add keyboard controls
    - Implement high-contrast mode
    - Add screen reader support
    - Create colorblind-friendly player distinctions

## Technical Debt

- Reorganize frontend code structure for better maintainability
- Implement proper testing for all components
- Create a build system for production optimization
- Document all component APIs
- Implement performance monitoring for 3D rendering
- Create automated tests for core gameplay visuals

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Focus | Estimated Time |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1     | Backend-completed feature visualization | 2 weeks |
| 2     | Core board and chess movement | 2 weeks |
| 3     | Player status and pause system | 2 weeks |
| 4     | Event visualization and connectivity | 2 weeks |
| 5     | Wallet integration & polish | 2 weeks |

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test tetromino Z-axis logic visualization
   - Verify pawn promotion counter and animation
   - Validate difficulty-based timers
   - Test row clearing animations

2. **Integration Tests**
