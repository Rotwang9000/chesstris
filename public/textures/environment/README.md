# Shaktris Environment Textures

This directory should contain the following texture files:

- `cloud.png` - Wispy cloud texture with alpha transparency
- `particle.png` - Particle texture for effects

## Cloud Texture
The cloud texture should be a white cloud with transparency for edges. 
For best results, use a resolution of at least 512x256 pixels.

## Particle Texture
The particle texture should be a soft, circular gradient from white in the center to transparent at the edges.
A resolution of 64x64 pixels is recommended.

You can create these textures in any image editing software or find free stock images online.
